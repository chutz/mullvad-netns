Shell script to spawn a command within a network namespace with the only
visible network link being Mullvad WireGuard tunnel connected to a random
server (within a certain country and/or city).

The configuration lives at `/etc/mullvad-netns/config`, it is a shell script
that is sourced when the program is run. There is a default configuration
installed that defines some variables. The location of the configuration file
can be also overriden by setting the `MULLVAD_NETNS_CONF` environment variable.

As a quick start, one should set their account number. The default location
of this file is `/etc/mullvad-netns/account`. This file must not be readable
by anyone other than root.

Usage:
  mullvad-netns [options] -- <command>
  mullvad-netns <command>

Run <command> under a network namespace connected to a randomly selected
Mullvad server over WireGuard as the only visible network device. This
ensures that the command does not have access to the network except through
the Mullvad tunnel.

                               given regular expression
